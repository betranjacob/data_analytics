A python exercise using Portuguese wine data.

The data you'll be working with can be used to make predictions about the quality of a wine based on its chemical make up.

This exercise is about munging the data into the correct shape to pass into a selection of models and to display charts providing insights into the data.

Prerequisites
  - Python 3 environment (exercise written using python 3.5.2 on Anaconda 4.2.0 (64 bit))
  - numpy, you're welcome to use additional data centric libraries if you'd like
  - A charting library of your choice, we used matplotlib
  - Git - this zip file contains an empty git repo, we're keen to see how you work
    - you're encouraged to commit early and often
    - if you're unfamiliar with git there are many tutorials online
    - please don't rewrite history (if you can help it)

What we're looking for
  - How you approach a real world problem
  - How you write code
  - Your approach to error handling and edge cases
  - Which libraries you're familiar with and use regularly
  - Your approach to testing
  - There's no 'correct' solution
    - We're interested in the choices (and compromises) you made to solve the problem

Getting started
  - Create a new branch and start working from there

Hope you enjoy the exercise!
